**Keylogger**

Description:
This Keylogger project captures and logs keystrokes from a user's keyboard. 

The keylogger records all key presses, including alphanumeric characters and special keys, along with timestamps for each event. 

To stop the keylogging session, simply press the esc key. 

All keystrokes are logged to a file named log.txt for review.
